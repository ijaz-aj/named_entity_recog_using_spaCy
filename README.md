# Named Entity Recognition using spaCy

## Overview:
This repository contains a Python script demonstrating Named Entity Recognition (NER) using spaCy. Named Entity Recognition is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves identifying and classifying named entities (e.g., persons, organizations, locations) in a text.

## Project Files:
- **`Named_Entity_Recognition_with_spaCy.py`**: Python script showcasing Named Entity Recognition with spaCy.
- **`LICENSE`**: Choose an appropriate license for your project.
- **`README.md`**: The file you're currently reading.

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Named_Entity_Recognition_with_spaCy.git
    cd ner-spacy
    ```

## Usage:
1. Open the `Named_Entity_Recognition_with_spaCy.py` script.
2. Customize the script by updating the input text or any other parameters as needed.
3. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python ner_example.py
    ```

## Results:
The script will output the named entities identified in the provided text. Customize the script to handle different types of texts and explore more features provided by spaCy.
